name: lensdiff
description: Ask the user for a code review by opening the changes in lensdiff, a local diff viewer. Explicit opt-in only — use when the user names lensdiff, asks to open or show the diff in the viewer, or has a standing instruction to request reviews through lensdiff after changes. Do not use it for ordinary requests to review code, diffs, commits, branches, or pull requests.

# Lensdiff

## When to Use This Skill

lensdiff opens an external browser UI and starts a long-running local server, so launching it must be explicit opt-in:

- Use this skill only when the user explicitly names lensdiff, asks to open or show the diff in a viewer, or has a standing instruction (for example in project docs or agent configuration) to request reviews through lensdiff after code changes.
- Do NOT use it for ordinary review requests such as "review these changes", "use the reviewer agent", "find problems in this diff", or "review this PR/commit/branch". Answer those through your normal response channel.
- When a request is ambiguous, prefer the non-lensdiff path.

## Overview

This skill requests a code review from the user using lensdiff.
Before running commands, choose `<lensdiff-command>` using the following rule:

- Use `lensdiff` if `command -v lensdiff` succeeds.
- Otherwise ask the user whether to install it globally with `npm install -g https://github.com/komtaki/lensdiff/releases/latest/download/lensdiff.tgz`, and run it only after they agree. Never substitute `difit` or `npx difit`.

If the user leaves review comments, they are printed to stdout when the chosen lensdiff command exits.
When review comments are returned, continue work and address them.
If the server is shut down without comments, treat it as "no review comments were provided." Restarting it is unnecessary.
Manual verification of whether the page launched correctly is also unnecessary.

## Commands

- Review uncommitted changes before commit: `<lensdiff-command> .`
- Review the HEAD commit: `<lensdiff-command>`
- Review staging area changes: `<lensdiff-command> staged`
- Review unstaged changes only: `<lensdiff-command> working`

Basic Usage:

```bash
<lensdiff-command> <target>                    # View single commit diff. ex: lensdiff 6f4a9b7
<lensdiff-command> <target> [compare-with]     # Compare two commits/branches. ex: lensdiff feature main
```

## Optional Startup Comments

If there is something you want to tell the user when lensdiff opens, attach it as startup comments with `--comment`.
This is useful for review findings, explanations, and any context the user should see directly on the diff.

```bash
<lensdiff-command> <target> [compare-with] \
  --comment '{"type":"thread","filePath":"src/foobar.ts","position":{"side":"old","line":102},"body":"line 1\nline 2"}' \
  --comment '{"type":"thread","filePath":"src/example.ts","position":{"side":"new","line":{"start":36,"end":39}},"body":"Range comment for L36-L39"}'
```

- Use `type: "thread"` for each comment.
- Write comment bodies in the language the user is using.
- Use `position.side: "new"` for lines that exist on the target side of the diff.
- Use `position.side: "old"` for lines that exist only on the deleted side.
- Use range comments for issues that span multiple lines.
- Never copy secrets, tokens, passwords, API keys, private keys, or other credential-like material from the diff into `--comment` bodies or any command-line arguments.

## Overview and Comment Kinds

`--overview <file>` shows a markdown file in the Overview tab. To replace it on a running server, use `<lensdiff-command> overview set --port <port> [file]` (reads stdin when `file` is omitted).

- Markdown is rendered with GitHub Flavored Markdown. Raw HTML (including inline SVG) is not rendered.
- A fenced code block with the language `mermaid` renders as a diagram.
- Inline code of the form `` `path/to/file.ext:line` `` becomes a button that jumps to that line when the file is in the diff. Ranges such as `:10-20` are not linked. The path must contain no spaces or colons and end with a file extension, so `Dockerfile:12` or `Makefile:3` is not linked either.

Every `--comment` / `comment add` thread accepts an optional `kind`:

- `comment` (default): a plain comment, always printed on exit.
- `explanation`: a code explanation. Printed on exit only when the user replied to it.
- `finding`: a review finding. Requires `reviewer`, `severity` (`info` | `warn` | `error`), and `title`; these fields are rejected for other kinds. The user can adopt or reject it. Printed on exit when adopted (the root body is prefixed with `[AI:<reviewer>] `) or replied to.

```json
{
  "type": "thread",
  "kind": "explanation",
  "filePath": "src/api.ts",
  "position": { "side": "new", "line": { "start": 10, "end": 18 } },
  "body": "Validates the body before the handler runs."
}
```

```json
{
  "type": "thread",
  "kind": "finding",
  "reviewer": "security",
  "severity": "warn",
  "title": "Unvalidated input",
  "filePath": "src/api.ts",
  "position": { "side": "new", "line": 42 },
  "body": "What happens, when, and how to fix it."
}
```

Line numbers refer to the diff as of launch. After new commits, take them again from the current files before relaunching or adding comments.

### Output on Exit

lensdiff exits with code 0 when the user closes the tab (without `--keep-alive`) or presses Approve (even with `--keep-alive`). Before exiting it prints to stdout:

- `📝 Comments from review session:` followed by the threads selected by the rules above, only when at least one thread is selected. With none, the header is omitted.
- `✅ Approved` as the last line when the user pressed Approve, whether or not comments were printed. It means the comments only need fixing, with no further review round.

Pressing Ctrl+C in the terminal also prints the selected comments (after `👋 Shutting down lensdiff server...`) and exits with code 0, but never prints `✅ Approved`.

With `--background`, the server's stdout is discarded, so nothing is printed to the caller on exit. Read the comments from the running server with `<lensdiff-command> comment get --port <port>` instead.

## Including Untracked Files

For uncommitted changes, if files not yet added to git should also appear in the diff, add `--include-untracked`.

```bash
<lensdiff-command> . --include-untracked
```

## Reusing a Running Server

Keep at most one live lensdiff server per Git root and review target. When you edit again after starting a review, reuse the running server instead of launching another one — repeated launches create duplicate ports and browser tabs.

- Before starting lensdiff, check whether a lensdiff server you started earlier is still running for the same Git root (for example, the background process you launched is still alive).
- If one is running for the same target, do not start another and do not reopen its URL. For working-tree targets (`.`, `working`, `staged`, and the HEAD default) lensdiff watches the repository, and the open page prompts the user to reload when the diff changes.
- If review rounds are expected to repeat, start the server with `--keep-alive` (the server survives browser disconnects) or `--background` (a detached keep-alive server; prints JSON like `{"port":4966,"url":"http://localhost:4966","pid":123}` and does not auto-open a browser, so share the URL with the user once).
- While the server stays alive, exchange feedback without restarting it:
  - `<lensdiff-command> comment get --port <port>` — read the user's review comments (`--format json` for structured output).
  - `<lensdiff-command> comment add --port <port> '<json>'` — add new comments to the running server (same JSON shape as `--comment`).
  - `<lensdiff-command> comment resolve <threadId...> --port <port>` — resolve threads you have addressed.
- If the review target changes (for example, a different commit range), stop the existing server and start a new one rather than leaving two servers for the same repository.

## Constraints

Can only be used inside a Git-managed directory.
